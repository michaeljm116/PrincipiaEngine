Principia Engine v 0.i.d.k

currently not functioning, most likely due to driver issues. For last functioning copy of the engine, check out my global game jam game here:

To do:

- Bounding Volume Heirarchy 
	- Using SAH
- SmartPointerize everything
- Physics, possibly replace Bullet3 with something ligher or just do my own now that BVH is done
- Animation 2.0, give everything a vertex weight of 1 and possibly try out giving each bone its own bounding box? 
	- then treat it as like a mid-level acceleration structure
- Speaking of which, I need to do a bottom-level accel structure too
- Audio 
- UI
