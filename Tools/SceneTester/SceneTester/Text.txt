okay so what you want to do is initialize and instantiate memory etc...
but then if you have prims left then do the left-righti stufff
how do you do this recursively?!?!??  or do u need to?!?!?

what if you do this breathfirsty
i mean doing this insertively youve done before....

step 1 build the node with no left and right
step 2 build the left and right
	but the left and right have no left and right
step 2 also if leaf then build leaf

find median and axis
instanciate node with those two things
link it to whatever tree structure its already apart of????
so there should be a setleft setright thing
it takes the prev node and sets it to the data
so you pass in the parent node and you put or no well idk u want no returns irght or do you why is this so  confusing rn?!?!?!
from 8 to 9

so the problem is you have 6 objects with the same center and extents... what do?!??!?

well if therre's a case where there's a 0... shouldn't the other by definition be a leaf?!?!?
