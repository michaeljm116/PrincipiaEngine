Artemis C++
===

A C++ port of [Artemis Entity System Framework](http://gamadu.com/artemis/tutorial.html).

The port was orignially written by [Sidar Talei](https://bitbucket.org/stalei/artemiscpp/src), in which he used several C++11 features such as deleted function, variadic templates, nullptr, etcâ€¦
We wanted the framework to be portable, so we removed all C++11 feature usages.

## Compiling

### CMake

CMake is a cross-platform, open source build system. You can find more information about CMake [here](https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmake.org%2F&ei=ZRhEUtGFA6el4ATa64HIBw&usg=AFQjCNEmd4p8aUoUmYlZxJdYtwYJnn1-cw&sig2=rna57CyVBIF9Oxh-i-_4FQ&bvm=bv.53217764,d.bGE).

It is very simple to compile Artemis-Cpp using CMake. Just follow these steps:

1. Install CMake in your system.
2. Make sure you have cmake in your `$PATH` variable.
3. Open a new terminal and go to Artemis-Cpp's folder.
4. `mkdir build`.
5. `cd build`.
6. `cmake ..`.
7. `make`.
8. `sudo make install`.
9. Enjoy.

### Mac OS X Framework

You can use Artemis-Cpp as a Framework for Mac OS X development using the _Artemis.framework_ we provide or compile your own Framework using the XCode project inside the _XCode_ folder.

### EXAMPLE

`VelocityComponent` and `PositionComponent`.

``` cpp
class VelocityComponent : public artemis::Component {
public:
    float velocityX;
    float velocityY;

    VelocityComponent(float velocityX, float velocityY)
    {
        this->velocityX = velocityX;
        this->velocityY = velocityY;
    };
};

class PositionComponent : public artemis::Component
{

public:
    float posX;
    float posY;
    PositionComponent(float posX, float posY)
    {
        this->posX = posX;
        this->posY = posY;
    };
};
```
	
MovementSystem updates positions base on velocities

``` cpp
class MovementSystem : public artemis::EntityProcessingSystem {
private:
    artemis::ComponentMapper<MovementComponent> velocityMapper;
    artemis::ComponentMapper<PositionComponent> positionMapper;

public:
    MovementSystem() {
        addComponentType<VelocityComponent>();
        addComponentType<PositionComponent>();
    };

    virtual void initialize() {
        velocityMapper.init(*world);
        positionMapper.init(*world);
    };

    virtual void processEntity(artemis::Entity &e) {
        positionMapper.get(e)->posX += velocityMapper.get(e)->velocityX * world->getDelta();
        positionMapper.get(e)->posY += velocityMapper.get(e)->velocityY * world->getDelta();
    };

};
```
	
Usage:

``` cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {

    artemis::World world;
    artemis::SystemManager * sm = world.getSystemManager();
    MovementSystem * movementsys = (MovementSystem*)sm->setSystem(new MovementSystem());
    artemis::EntityManager * em = world.getEntityManager();

    sm->initializeAll();

    artemis::Entity & player = em->create();

    player.addComponent(new MovementComponent(2,4));
    player.addComponent(new PositionComponent(0,0));
    player.refresh();

    PositionComponent * comp = (PositionComponent*)player.getComponent<PositionComponent>();

    while(true){

        world.loopStart();
        world.setDelta(0.0016f);
        movementsys->process();

        std::cout << "X:"<< comp->posX << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Y:"<< comp->posY << std::endl;
        Sleep(160);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### LOGS
- Dec 10, 2012:
	- [Fixed  bug](https://github.com/vinova/Artemis-Cpp/commit/449ee9d3167d6bdf8056a8da7554ebec016e5b65): calling Bag.get(index) not returning NULL when index > bag's size,
	which leads to memory violation when the number of entities becomes greater than initialized entities bag size.
- Nov 15, 2012:
	- [Fixed  bug](https://github.com/vinova/Artemis-Cpp/commit/fe291598b699cd283fc029ee727669b8e7a76e24): memory leak when add a component to an entity
	who already had this component.
- Sept 11, 2012:
	- [Fixed critical bug](https://github.com/vinova/Artemis-Cpp/commit/731d2c3e6f4afbd32e4d33f08f23373d62b91dd9): deleting World doesn't delete/reset all neccessary data,
which will lead to memory violation when a World is deleted and a new one is created.
- Sept 12, 2012:
	- Removed all C++11 feature usages.
